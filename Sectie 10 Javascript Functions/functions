//Functions descriptions
Functions lets us store lines of code, like a variable but reusable. You dont have to write lots of code (DRY = Don't Repeat Yourself).

//Arguments are placed in () after declerating a function.
example
function square(num) {
	console.log(num * num);
}

square(10); //prints 100

//Return keyword
example for printing out a string and the selected number.
function square(num) {
	return ("This number is " + num);
}

//Intro to scope
Scope is the context that code is executed in

//Higher order functions code along, you can pass a argument to a other function.
function sing() {
	console.log("twinkle twinkle");
	console.log("how i wonder");
}

setInterval(sing, 1000);

setInterval(function() {
	console.log("What cool");
	console.log("This is awesome");
}, 2000);
