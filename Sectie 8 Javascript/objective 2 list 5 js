Primitive datatypes:
Numbers:
4
9.3
-10

	//math
	4 + 10 //14
	1/5 //0.2
	2*5 //10

	//Modulo - remainder operator - it will take the remaining number. If you have 10 %(mod) 3 then the remaining is 1, because you van fit 3 times 3 = 9  and the remainder is 1. 
	10 % 3 //1
	24 % 2 //0
	15 % 11 //4

Strings are text mostly and are inside of quotes:
"hello world"
"43"

	//single or double quotes
	"hello world"
	'hello world'
	//note you can't use a single quote in a string if you have text with a single quote: 'I can't eat' it needs to be "I can't eat"

	//Concatenation
	"charlie" + "brown" //"charliebrown" but if you want it with a space you need to write it like this "charlie" + " brown"

	//Escape Characters start with "\"
	"singin" \ "Do wah diddy, diddy, dum diddy do\" "

	//Strings have a length property
	"hello world".length //11

	//access individual characters using [] and an index (starts with 0)
	"hello"[0] //"h" 
	"hello"[4] //"o"

Booleans have two options:
true
false

Null and undefined (values):
null
undefined
	//The two other primitives are null and undefined

	//Variables that are declared but not 
	//initialized are undefined
	//The following variables are undefined:
	var name;
	var age;

	//null is "explicitly nothing"
	var currentPlayer = "charlie";
	currentPlayer = null;   //game over

Variables:
	//Variables are simply containers that store values
	//They follow this pattern:
	var yourVariableName = yourValue;

	//They can store all of the values we've seen
	var name = "Rusty";
	var secretNumber = 73;
	var isAdorable = true;

	//Recall the stored value by calling the variable name
	var name = "Rusty";
	"hello there " + name    //"hello there Rusty"

	var num = 37;
	num + 3 + 10    //50

	//We can also update existing variables
	var name = "Robert";
	name = "Bob"; 

	//There are new ways to store values
	//prefer const over let
	//prefer let over var
	//USE var PRETTY MUCH NEVER
	(you probably don't need it)

	var ()

	//blocked scoped
	let ()
	
	//blocked scoped
	const (the value can't be changed, has already been declared)
