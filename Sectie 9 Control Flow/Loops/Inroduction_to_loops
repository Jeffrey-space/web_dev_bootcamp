// Introduction to Loops //
DRY Code: Don't Repeat Yourself
We want to keep out code as DRY as possible. It saves us a lot of time and makes our code cleaner.

//While Loops
Repeat code WHILE a condition is true

//Printing numbers from 1-5
const count = 1;

while(count < 6) {
	console.log("count is: " + count);
	count++;
}

//Printing each character in a string
//string we're looping over:
const str = "hello";
//first character is a index 0
const count = 0;

while(count < str.length) {
	console.log(str[count]);
	count++;
}

//Infinite Loops
Infinite loops occur when the terminating
condition in a loop is never true

example
const count = 0;

while(count < 10) {
	console.log(count);
}


// Intro to For Loops //
While vs For loops

//Printing numbers from 1-5 with a for loop
//Another way for repeating code
for(var count = 1; count < 6; count++) {
	console.log(count);
}

//Printing numbers from 1-5 with a for loop
var count = 0;

while(count < 6) {
	console.log("count is: " + count);
	count++;
}
